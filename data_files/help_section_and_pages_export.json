              "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>Many of the forms in the data portal allow you to enter content in multiple languages. This is done by grouping each field that can be in multiple languages into a tabular block. Each tab contains the exact same fields, the only difference is what language the content should be entered in.</p>\r\n<p>The image below shows two possible languages for the Title form field - English and Georgian (ქართული).</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English tab open\" /></p>\r\n<p>In the above image, the English tab is currently active, which is indicated by the tab's white background. Below is an image of what it looks like when the Georgian tab is active.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab2.png\" alt=\"Form translations with Georgian tab open\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Default Language and Entering Required Fields</h2>\r\n<p>Many of these multiple language fields are required fields, however only one language needs to have values in the required fields in order for the form to save. That language that is required is the language in the first tab. For instance, in the following image, the English language required field of Title must be entered in order for the form to save.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English tab open\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Entering Only One Language</h3>\r\n<p>Since only one language is required, it may be tempting to only enter the one required language and not enter the other language(s). There is a consequence of this action that you should be aware of.</p>\r\n<p>Let's say that you are entering text for the top of the <a href=\"/en/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact page</a> and that you only enter the English text. When you access the English version of the data portal, you will see the English text. However, when you access the Georgian version of the site, since there is no Georgian text for the Contact page, the English text will be shown. This means that if that requested language does not have content, then the language from the first tab will be shown instead. This will result in a page with multiple languages on it, which is not ideal.</p>\r\n<p>So in the ideal situation, all languages should be entered so that no page will have multiple languages on it.</p>\r\n<h2>Choosing Languages for Datasets and Time Series</h2>\r\n<p>For most of the data portal forms with multiple language fields, there will always be a tab for English and Georgian. However, the forms to add a <a href=\"/en/support/manage_datasets\" target=\"_blank\">Datsaet</a>, <a href=\"/en/support/manage_time_series\" target=\"_blank\">Time Series</a>, and <a href=\"/en/support/admin/shapesets\" target=\"_blank\">Shapeset</a> work slightly differently.</p>\r\n<p>In these forms, you get to choose which languages you want to publish the content in, as seen in the image below from the Dataset form.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_one_lang.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English language selected\" /></p>\r\n<p>This form has two fields for choosing the language:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Language of Dataset - select one or more languages</li>\r\n<li>Default Language - select which of the languages from the Language of Dataset field is the default language</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Selecting a Default Language indicates which language to show by default if the user has not selected a language. It also indicates which required form fields in the language tab must be entered in order for the form to be saved. The Default Language will be in the first tab and a star icon will be added to the tab to help visually indicate that this is the Default Language.</p>\r\n<p>When you add more languages, the tab for that language will automatically appear. In the following image, the Georgian language has been added in the Language of Dataset field and a Georgian tab is now visible.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_two_lang.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English and Georgian languages selected\" /></p>\r\n<p>Now if you change the Default Language to Georgian, you will see below how the first tab is now the Georgian tab.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_two_lang_ka_default.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English and Georgian languages selected, Georgian as default\" /></p>\r\n<p>To be clear, you are not limited to just the English and Georgian languages. You can select from over 60 languages as see below.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_lang_dropdown.png\" alt=\"Language of Dataset field with dropdown open\" /></p>\r\n<h3>What Choosing a Language Allows You To Do</h3>\r\n<p>When you choose one or more languages for a Dataset and Time Series, you are indicating to the data portal what languages the data can be translated into. For instance, if you choose English, Georgian, and Russian this means all of the text for questions, answers, groups, etc. can be translated into all three of these languages.</p>\r\n<h3>Entering Only One Language</h3>\r\n<p>The same rules apply as in the Entering Only One Language section above.</p>\r\n<p>Let's say you selected the three languages of English, Georgian, and Russian but only enter English text. This means that when someone selects to view the Russian language, they will be shown the English text since no Russian text exists.</p>\r\n<p>So in the ideal situation, all languages should be entered so that no page will have multiple languages on it. However, if you do not have time to translate all of the content, it is strongly advised that you only select the languages that you can translate now and at a later time go back and add in the other languages when you have the text translated.</p>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Below are links to other guides in the <a href=\"/en/support/general/forms\">Forms guide book</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/general/forms/guide/errors\">Validation Errors</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/general/forms/guide/hints\">Form Field Hints</a></li>\r\n</ul>"

There can be small variations of the same map so read the map names carefully.</p>\r\n<h2>Matching Question Answers to Map Shapes</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_map_form_matching.png\" alt=\"Matching question answers to map shapes\" /></p>\r\n<p>After you select the question and map, a table will be created with two columns. The left column is the list of possible answers for the question. The right column is where you need to select the corresponding map shape for each possible question answers.</p>\r\n<p>After making the question and map selection, the data portal will automatically try to find matches. When it does, the map shapes will be pre-selected. When it does not, the map shape selector will have a red highlight around it to try and make it obvious that these fields need attention. When you make a selection, the red highlight will disappear.</p>\r\n<h2>Adjustable Map Scale</h2>\r\n<p>The last form field asks if you want the map color scale to be fixed or if you want it to be adjusted to match the question response range. By default, with a value of No, the map scale goes from 0 - 100%. For some cases this may be fine. But if the question data results in each map shape having similar values, the differences might not be visually noticeable. For instance, look at the map below which is not using an adjustable scale.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_map_scale_no.png\" alt=\"Map scale is 0-100%\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you look at the percent values on the map, you will see that percents range from about 3% to about 30%.

On this page, you can see a list of all the API Version and API Method records in the data portal.</p>\r\n<h3>API</h3>\r\n<p>The data portal has an <a href=\"/en/api\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> (application programming interface) which means any developer can create an app that can programmatically access the data in the portal data and use it for their own purpose. For example, think of all of the weather apps that are out there. There are only a few services that actually track the weather and these apps use an API to get the weather and then show it in some unique way that their users will like.</p>\r\n<p>The data portal API offers the following access to the data:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Catalog</strong> - get a list of all the datasets</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Details</strong> - get the details for a dataset (i.e., name, methodology, dates, reports, etc)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Codebook</strong> - get the codebook for a dataset (i.e, a list of questions and possible answers)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Analysis</strong> - run an analysis for a question in a dataset</li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Catalog</strong> - get a list of all the time series<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Details</strong> - get the details for a time series (i.e, name, datasets, dates, etc)<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Codebook</strong> - get the codebook for a time series (i.e., a list of questions and possible answers)<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong> - run an analysis for a question in a time series</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>API Method</h3>\r\n<p>An API Method allows a person to get specific information from the data portal. Each of the items listed above are API Methods (i.e., catalog of datasets, dataset details, dataset analysis, etc). The API Method documentation indicates the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the URL to access the method</li>\r\n<li>a list of required parameters, if any</li>\r\n<li>a list of optional parameters, if any</li>\r\n<li>what is returned when the method is called</li>\r\n<li>examples of calling the method with parameters and what information is returned</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>API Version</h3>\r\n<p>An API Version is a collection of API Methods.

However, it is possible that the list of questions can be extremely long (i.e., over 500 questions), so if you know the question text use the search box at the top of the question list to quickly find what you want.</p>\r\n<p>The meaning of the icons on the right side of the list will be explained in the following sections.</p>\r\n<h2>Categorical and Numerical Data Types</h2>\r\n<p>Each question is either categorical or numerical:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Categorical - The question has a predefined list of possible answers (i.e., Region, Urban / Rural, Education Level, etc) and is indicated with the following icon:<br />\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_categorical_icon.png\" alt=\"Categorical question icon\" /></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Numerical - The question is numerical and has no predefined list of possible answers (i.e., Age, Weight, Salary, etc) and is indicated with the following icon:<br />\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_numerical_icon.png\" alt=\"Numerical question icon\" /></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Analysis Types</h2>\r\n<h3>Single</h3>\r\n<p>A single analysis means that you want to view the responses for a question. This is accomplished by selecting a question under 'Explore Answers To' and not selecting a question from 'Broken Down By'.</p>\r\n<h4>Categorical Questions</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_single.png\" alt=\"Chart of single categorical question analysis\" /></p>\r\n<p>A single analysis of a categorical question will return a bar chart indicating what percent of the respondents selected each possible answer. In the top-left corner of the chart, you have the ability to switch between a bar chart and a pie chart. This option is only available for this single categorical question analysis.</p>\r\n<h4>Numerical Questions</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_single_numerical.png\" alt=\"Chart of single numerical question analysis\" /></p>\r\n<p>A single analysis of a numerical question will return a histogram showing the breakdown of all responses grouped into particular ranges.</p>\r\n<h3>Comparative</h3>\r\n<p>A comparative analysis means that you want to compare the responses from two questions. This is accomplished by selecting a question under 'Explore Answers To' and also selecting a question from 'Broken Down By'.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that you can only compare questions that are of the same type, meaning that you can compare categorical questions to each other and numerical questions to each other, but you cannot compare a categorical question to a numerical question.</p>\r\n<h4>Categorical Questions</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_compare.png\" alt=\"Chart of comparative categorical question analysis\" /></p>\r\n<p>A comparative analysis of categorical questions will return a stacked bar chart indicating what percent of the respondents selected an answer from each question.</p>\r\n<h4>Numerical Questions</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_compare_numerical.png\" alt=\"Chart of comparative numerical question analysis\" /></p>\r\n<p>A comparative analysis of numerical questions will return a scatter plot chart indicating how many respondents selected an answer from each question. Light colored circles indicate few people responded with those particular answers while dark circles indicate many people responded with those particular answers.</p>\r\n<h3>Comparative - Filtered</h3>\r\n<p>A comparative analysis with a filter means that you want to compare the responses from two questions filtered by the answers from a third question. This is accomplished by selecting a question under 'Explore Answers To', selecting a question from 'Broken Down By', and also selecting a question from 'Filtered By'.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that only categorical questions can be used as filters.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_compare_filter.png\" alt=\"Chart of comparative question analysis with a filter\" /></p>\r\n<p>A comparative analysis of categorical questions with a filter will return a stacked bar chart for each possible answer in the filter question. The chart indicates what percent of the respondents selected an answer from all three questions. You will have to look at the title of each chart to see which filter answer is being charted. You will have to scroll down the page to see the chart for each filter answer.</p>\r\n<h2>Maps</h2>\r\n<p>In addition to viewing results in a chart, some results can also be viewed on a map. Questions that have a geographic reference like Region and District may have the following icon to indicate that the results can be viewed on a map:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_map_icon.png\" alt=\"Mappable question icon\" /></p>\r\n<p>When you select a mappable question, an additional Map tab will appear after the Chart tab, as seen below. The map is color coded to indicate the response rate from each shape, where a darker color means more people responded in that shape. Hover over a shape to get the shape name and results.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"drop-downs-dataset-options\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_map.png\" alt=\"Map of single analysis\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Weights</h2>\r\n<p>When surveys are conducted, it is impossible to survey every single person in a desired population and so only a small subset of the population is questioned. However, if the survey participants are selected properly, it is possible to apply the results of the survey to the desired population. The process of converting the survey results to the population is called weighting the data.</p>\r\n<p>If a dataset has weighted data, the weight will automatically be applied during analysis so the results you are viewing is what applies to the desired population. Look at the 'Weighted By' field to determine if a weight is being used in your analysis.</p>\r\n<p>If a weight is used, the sub-titles in the results will use the label 'Total Unweighted Responses' followed by a red *. The red * indicates that there is a footnote and in the bottom-left of the results the footnote will indicate which weight was applied to the analysis, like the following:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_single.png\" alt=\"Chart of single categorical question analysis\" /></p>\r\n<p>If a weight is not applied to the analysis, then the sub-titles in the results will use the label 'Total Responses', like the following:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_single_no_weight.png\" alt=\"Chart of single question analysis with no weight\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Exporting the Analysis</h2>\r\n<p>You have the ability to export the analysis results in a couple different ways.</p>\r\n<p>In the top-right corner of the chart are the following icons:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_export.png\" alt=\"Export links in chart\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Red link icon - click on this to get the code to embed the chart</li>\r\n<li>Blue down arrow icon - click on this to download the chart as an image or PDF file</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Embed</h3>\r\n<p>When you click on the red link icon to embed the chart, you will get a popup like the following:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"drop-downs-dataset-options\" src=\"/guide_images/dataset_explore_chart_embed.png\" alt=\"Embed a chart popup\" /></p>\r\n<p>Simple copy the code into your web page to embed the chart.
