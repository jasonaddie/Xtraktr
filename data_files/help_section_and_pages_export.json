              "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>Many of the forms in the data portal allow you to enter content in multiple languages. This is done by grouping each field that can be in multiple languages into a tabular block. Each tab contains the exact same fields, the only difference is what language the content should be entered in.</p>\r\n<p>The image below shows two possible languages for the Title form field - English and Georgian (ქართული).</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English tab open\" /></p>\r\n<p>In the above image, the English tab is currently active, which is indicated by the tab's white background. Below is an image of what it looks like when the Georgian tab is active.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab2.png\" alt=\"Form translations with Georgian tab open\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Default Language and Entering Required Fields</h2>\r\n<p>Many of these multiple language fields are required fields, however only one language needs to have values in the required fields in order for the form to save. That language that is required is the language in the first tab. For instance, in the following image, the English language required field of Title must be entered in order for the form to save.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_tab.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English tab open\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Entering Only One Language</h3>\r\n<p>Since only one language is required, it may be tempting to only enter the one required language and not enter the other language(s). There is a consequence of this action that you should be aware of.</p>\r\n<p>Let's say that you are entering text for the top of the <a href=\"/en/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact page</a> and that you only enter the English text. When you access the English version of the data portal, you will see the English text. However, when you access the Georgian version of the site, since there is no Georgian text for the Contact page, the English text will be shown. This means that if that requested language does not have content, then the language from the first tab will be shown instead. This will result in a page with multiple languages on it, which is not ideal.</p>\r\n<p>So in the ideal situation, all languages should be entered so that no page will have multiple languages on it.</p>\r\n<h2>Choosing Languages for Datasets and Time Series</h2>\r\n<p>For most of the data portal forms with multiple language fields, there will always be a tab for English and Georgian. However, the forms to add a <a href=\"/en/support/manage_datasets\" target=\"_blank\">Datsaet</a>, <a href=\"/en/support/manage_time_series\" target=\"_blank\">Time Series</a>, and <a href=\"/en/support/admin/shapesets\" target=\"_blank\">Shapeset</a> work slightly differently.</p>\r\n<p>In these forms, you get to choose which languages you want to publish the content in, as seen in the image below from the Dataset form.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_one_lang.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English language selected\" /></p>\r\n<p>This form has two fields for choosing the language:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Language of Dataset - select one or more languages</li>\r\n<li>Default Language - select which of the languages from the Language of Dataset field is the default language</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Selecting a Default Language indicates which language to show by default if the user has not selected a language. It also indicates which required form fields in the language tab must be entered in order for the form to be saved. The Default Language will be in the first tab and a star icon will be added to the tab to help visually indicate that this is the Default Language.</p>\r\n<p>When you add more languages, the tab for that language will automatically appear. In the following image, the Georgian language has been added in the Language of Dataset field and a Georgian tab is now visible.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_two_lang.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English and Georgian languages selected\" /></p>\r\n<p>Now if you change the Default Language to Georgian, you will see below how the first tab is now the Georgian tab.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_two_lang_ka_default.png\" alt=\"Form translations with English and Georgian languages selected, Georgian as default\" /></p>\r\n<p>To be clear, you are not limited to just the English and Georgian languages. You can select from over 60 languages as see below.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-three-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/form_translations_lang_dropdown.png\" alt=\"Language of Dataset field with dropdown open\" /></p>\r\n<h3>What Choosing a Language Allows You To Do</h3>\r\n<p>When you choose one or more languages for a Dataset and Time Series, you are indicating to the data portal what languages the data can be translated into. For instance, if you choose English, Georgian, and Russian this means all of the text for questions, answers, groups, etc. can be translated into all three of these languages.</p>\r\n<h3>Entering Only One Language</h3>\r\n<p>The same rules apply as in the Entering Only One Language section above.</p>\r\n<p>Let's say you selected the three languages of English, Georgian, and Russian but only enter English text. This means that when someone selects to view the Russian language, they will be shown the English text since no Russian text exists.</p>\r\n<p>So in the ideal situation, all languages should be entered so that no page will have multiple languages on it. However, if you do not have time to translate all of the content, it is strongly advised that you only select the languages that you can translate now and at a later time go back and add in the other languages when you have the text translated.</p>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Below are links to other guides in the <a href=\"/en/support/general/forms\">Forms guide book</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/general/forms/guide/errors\">Validation Errors</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/general/forms/guide/hints\">Form Field Hints</a></li>\r\n</ul>"

On this page, you can see a list of all the API Version and API Method records in the data portal.</p>\r\n<h3>API</h3>\r\n<p>The data portal has an <a href=\"/en/api\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> (application programming interface) which means any developer can create an app that can programmatically access the data in the portal data and use it for their own purpose. For example, think of all of the weather apps that are out there. There are only a few services that actually track the weather and these apps use an API to get the weather and then show it in some unique way that their users will like.</p>\r\n<p>The data portal API offers the following access to the data:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Catalog</strong> - get a list of all the datasets</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Details</strong> - get the details for a dataset (i.e., name, methodology, dates, reports, etc)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Codebook</strong> - get the codebook for a dataset (i.e, a list of questions and possible answers)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dataset Analysis</strong> - run an analysis for a question in a dataset</li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Catalog</strong> - get a list of all the time series<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Details</strong> - get the details for a time series (i.e, name, datasets, dates, etc)<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Codebook</strong> - get the codebook for a time series (i.e., a list of questions and possible answers)<strong><br /></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong> - run an analysis for a question in a time series</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>API Method</h3>\r\n<p>An API Method allows a person to get specific information from the data portal. Each of the items listed above are API Methods (i.e., catalog of datasets, dataset details, dataset analysis, etc). The API Method documentation indicates the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the URL to access the method</li>\r\n<li>a list of required parameters, if any</li>\r\n<li>a list of optional parameters, if any</li>\r\n<li>what is returned when the method is called</li>\r\n<li>examples of calling the method with parameters and what information is returned</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>API Version</h3>\r\n<p>An API Version is a collection of API Methods. When a major change occurs to the data portal features, a new API version should be created with a new set of API methods that can use the new major change.</p>\r\n<h2>Column Explanations</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Title</strong> - This is the title of the text. This title may ore may not be shown in the data portal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Permalink</strong> - The URL to the API Version in the API section (i.e., /en/api/v1)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Make Available to the Public</strong> - Whether or not the API Version should be released to the world.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Methods</strong> - A list of all the methods in this version</li>\r\n<li><strong>Actions</strong> - This is where you will find the buttons to edit and delete a record.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Row Order</h2>\r\n<p>The rows are sorted by the Title.</p>\r\n<p>In each row, the Method column has a listing of all API Methods in the API Version. The API Methods are sorted in the order indicated by the API Method Sort Order field and is the same order the API Methods will appear on the <a href=\"/en/api\" target=\"_blank\">API page</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Page Actions</h2>\r\n<p>Below is a list of links and buttons that you can click on this page.</p>\r\n<h3>Gray Bar</h3>\r\n<p><img class=\"gray-bar\" src=\"/guide_images/common_listing_gray.png\" alt=\"Gray bar buttons\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New - click to create a new API Version record.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Admin Section - click to go back to the page that lists all of the sections in the Admin Section</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Table Columns</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"/guide_images/api_version_listing_table.png\" alt=\"Table column links\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New button in the Method column - click to add a API Method record to the API Version</li>\r\n<li>Link in Method column - click to view the API Method record</li>\r\n<li>Blue pencil icon in the Actions column - click to edit the API Version record</li>\r\n<li>Red X icon in the Actions column - click to delete the API Version record</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Below are links to other guides in the <a href=\"/en/support/admin/api_documentation\">API Documentation guide book</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/admin/api_documentation/guide/version_form\">API Version Form Page</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/admin/api_documentation/guide/method_view\">API Method View Page</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/admin/api_documentation/guide/method_form\">API Method Form Page</a></li>\r\n</ul>",

Check this form field to indicate that you want to receive notifications. You can then indicate if you want to receive notifications in English or Georgian (ქართული).</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/account_form_notifications.png\" alt=\"Notification form field in the create account form\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Below are links to other guides in the <a href=\"/en/support/user\">User Account guide book</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/user/guide/settings\">User Settings</a></li>\r\n</ul>",

You can use this form to change your email, password, notification settings, etc.</p>\r\n<h2>API Access Tokens</h2>\r\n<p>The data portal has an <a href=\"/en/api\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> (application programming interface) which means any developer can create an app that can programmatically access the data in the portal data and use it for their own purpose. For example, think of all of the weather apps that are out there. There are only a few services that actually track the weather and these apps use an API to get the weather and then show it in some unique way that their users will like.</p>\r\n<p>In order to use the data portal API, you must create an access token so that UNICEF knows who is using the API. To get an access token, simply click on red Get API Access Token button.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons\" src=\"/guide_images/account_api_button.png\" alt=\"Button to create an API access token\" /></p>\r\n<p>After you click on this button, your access token will appear in a table below the button.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"form-buttons-two-lines\" src=\"/guide_images/account_api_token.png\" alt=\"An API access token\" /></p>\r\n<p>Now that you have an access token, please refer to the <a href=\"/en/api\">API documentation</a> on how to make API calls.</p>\r\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\r\n<p>Below are links to other guides in the <a href=\"/en/support/user\">User Account guide book</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/en/support/user/guide/create_account\">Create Account</a></li>\r\n</ul>",
