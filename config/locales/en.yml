      no_answers: |
        The following %{number} questions do not have a list of possible answers. If your data file is a from a statistical package (SPSS, STATA, etc), this happens because the question is numerical or because a categorical question did not have a predefined list of answers. If your data file is a spreadsheet (CSV, XLSX, etc), this happens because you need to define which questions are numerical and which are categorical.

        To define which questions are numerical or categorical, use the <a href="%{link}">Data Type form</a>.

        To define answers for a categorical question, use the 'Add Answers' button below.

        These questions will not be available for analysis unless the data type is set to numerical or answers are defined to categorical questions.

        Use this page to indicate the data type of each question. A question that does not have a data type selected cannot be analyzed. If a question does not have pre-defined answers it cannot be selected as Categorical.

        For numerical questions, a histogram chart will be used during analysis. You can set the histogram bar size and the min and max value of the chart.
      no_questions: There are no questions on file for this dataset.
      no_answer: Question does not have predefined answers and, therefore, cannot be selected as a categorical type.

        This page allows you to sort all groups and questions into the order that you desire.

        By defualt, the question sort order is set to be the same as the order of the questions in the data file.

        When groups are added, the group sort order is initially set so the groups appear at the top of the list.

        If you have created groups, you can view and sort the items in that group by clicking on the button in the last column in the table.

        Groups will be visible in the codebook and on the explore page. It is up to you on whether or not the group description is included in the chart titles.

        By default, groups are put at the top of the codebook and all ungrouped questions will appear after the groups. You can use the %{link} to further control the order of the groups and questions.

        A dataset can have multiple weights, but one must be selected as the default weight. A default weight is automatically applied to all questions. For weights that are not the default weight, you can choose to apply the weight to all of the questions or only specific questions.

        During analysis, if two questions are being compared and they are of different weights, the default weight is used for both.
